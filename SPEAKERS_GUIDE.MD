## Talk structure

A presentation consists of 3 parts:
- Talk(duh) - this is the **pre-recorded** portion of your talk
- Formal Q&A - this is the **live** Q&A session that happens after the pre-recorded part is finished
- Informal Q&A - this is an **optional** continuation of the Formal Q&A, that happens in a different room when the time is up

There are 2 important fields in penta regarding the duration of the talk:
- Duration - this is the total length of the allotted time slot(**Talk + Formal Q&A**)
- Presentation Length (without Q&A)	- well, this is basically the length of the **Talk** portion

###### Example:
- Start time = 12:00
- Duration = 30 minutes
- Presentation Length = 22 minutes

This means:
- at exactly 12:00 the pre-recorded video will start playing
- at 12:22:30 the stream will switch over to the live feed with the speaker & moderator/host for the **Formal Q&A**
- at 12:30 the speaker & audience will get a chance to switch to a different channel to continue the discussion, before the next pre-recorded video will start playing


## How to pre-record your talk

There are currently 2 obvious ways to record the talks:
- Conference call record(**recommended**) - we would set up a call with one of the moderators/hosts, and record the online presentation(Jitsi, Zoom, Meets...etc)
- Record by yourself - meaning you as speaker are free to choose whatever software(OBS?) or green screen or what not to make the talk as fancy as possible
    - it is recommended that a moderator/host be present for this as well(four eyes principal)

Unless you want to show lots of live demos and do super fancy schmancy stuff, then a conference call recording will probably be sufficient.


### Recording deadline
We haven't heard about the official deadline yet, but for the time being **January 17th 2021** will serve as our deadline.

#### How to upload the video?
TBA

## Glossary

Moderators=Hosts=Devroom mods=Speaker Hosts: basically somebody from the devroom team or volunteers that would help set up calls, and also help organize the live Formal Q&A chatrooms and video feeds.
